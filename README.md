$ public CreateOrderSaga(OrderServiceProxy orderService, CustomerServiceProxy customerService, InvoiceServiceProxy invoiceService) {
		this.sagaDefinition =
				step()
					.withCompensation(orderService.reject, this::makeRejectOrderCommand)
				.step()
					.invokeParticipant(customerService.validateOrder, this::makeValidateOrderByCustomer)						
				.step()
					.invokeParticipant(invoiceService.requestInvoice, this::makeRequestInvoice)
					.onReply(InvoiceInfo.class, this::handleInvoiceReply)
					.withCompensation(invoiceService.cancelInvoice, this::makeCancelRequestInvoice)
				.step()
					.invokeParticipant(orderService.complete, this::makeCompleteOrderCommand)	
				.build();
```
